My first thought to solve this challenge was to loop through the prices array and subtract each current price from the rest of the prices. That led to days from the past being subtracted by days from the future and giving profits that are not possible. To fix this, instead of setting i = 0 at the beginning of each loop, I set i = to the index of the current price + 1 and then began the loop. Then of course while the loop is going, i is getting 1 added to it to move on to the next day.
